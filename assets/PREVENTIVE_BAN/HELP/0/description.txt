This section of the Discord Bot aims to reduce scams and spam, by banning known bad accounts even before they join.

This works thanks to all the verified Servers that use the Bot. When a person gets banned on multiple verified Servers that use the Bot, the Bot automatically bans that person on all other Servers.


This makes it significantly harder for Scammers and Spammers to harm a lot of Servers and People, because their Accounts become practically useless after just a few Servers.
