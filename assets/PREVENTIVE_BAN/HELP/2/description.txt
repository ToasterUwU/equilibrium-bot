So far, there are only two Commands that are for Moderators and Admins of verified Servers:

{ENABLE_OR_DISABLE_PREVENTIVE_BAN_COMMAND_MENTION} This Command enables/disables automatic banning and contribution to the Network.
{SET_LOG_WEBHOOK_COMMAND_MENTION} This Command allows you to give the Bot a Discord Webhook URL that it will send log messages about banned people to.
