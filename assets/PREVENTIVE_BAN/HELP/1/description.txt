First, you need to use {APPLY_FOR_VERIFICATION_COMMAND_MENTION} to apply for verification. This has to be done by a Moderator or higher on the Server that should be verified.

After that, the Bot will send you an Invite to the official Server and a link to the Ticket on the Offical Discord for that Application. From here, you just wait until a Team member gets in touch with you.

Generally speaking, there are no fixed requirements for becoming verified. As long as it's an active Server with more than 100 people and that is older than a few months, it should be no problem.

The reason we have to verify Servers before they get access to this feature is so that no one can make a bunch of fake Servers, ban a person on these Servers and therefore ban a Person on hundreds of Servers. So this is to prevent abuse.
